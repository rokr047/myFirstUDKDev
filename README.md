myFirstUDKDev - BIG BOX
=======================

Got this up and running in a couple of hours while learning UDK.

The short video of the level is at youtube : http://youtu.be/xRiEhDC_Swg

To Do: 

1. make the big bad robot animate and use it in a Boss Fight.
2. get the original gameplay done: enemy spawn equation. # of current enemy = 2^n (n = level)
